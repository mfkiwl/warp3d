c
c       The analysis uses CTOA growth with the constant front algorithm,
c       which enforces uniform growth along the crack front. Measurement
c       of the CTOA occurs at a distance (Lc) of 0.04" from the crack tip.
c       The element size on the crack plane in the direction of growth (Le)
c       is 0.02", thus generally providing two elements between the crack
c       tip and the point at which the CTOA is evaluated.  When the CTOA
c       at the master node reaches the critical value (5.6 degrees), then
c       the crack advances by the distance Lc (in this case, 0.04", or
c       roughly two elements).
