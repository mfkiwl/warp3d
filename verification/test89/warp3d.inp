!  Plane-strain model of C(T) with blunt notch and nearby circular hole.
!  Crack initiation and growth using SMCS criteria with various options.
!  
!  Problem is similar to Sandia Challenge I: The Sandia Fracture 
!       Challenge: blind round robin predictions of ductile tearing
!
!  Int J Fract (2014) 186:5â€“68. DOI 10.1007/s10704-013-9904-6
!
!  Geometry is similar but not exactly the same as model in paper. Sandia
!  specimen has 3 holes asymmetrically located about the the blunt notch
!  plane. The model here has 2 holes symmetric about the blunt notch plane.
!  The model here is slightly larger as well. Plane-strain thickness is 0.1 in.
!
!  Material is 15-5 PH stainless steel. Thickness 3.1 mm. Mostly
!  isotropic.
!
!  Crack/initiation growth in this model uses Wellman's tearing
!  parameter calibrated for the material.
!
!  Model is symmetric about Y=0 plane. Sandia test article is not
!  symmetric.
!
!  Plane strain used here to manage run times for a verification
!  test case.
!
!  By step 250, lots of growth. At step 500,the crack has breached hole
!
!  For lots of crack growth, the load step sizes need to approach
!  the sizes used in explicit solutions.
!
!  Solution convergence is still just too sensitive to load step size.
!  Adaptive load steps on global Newton doesn't really help.
