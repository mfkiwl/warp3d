!    ductile crack growth in a shallow notch se(b)
!    ============================================                       
! 
!            W=2 in,  span/2=4 in, B=0.001 in, a/W=0.15
!            uses crack growth by element extinction
! 
!    nonlinear material, large displacements, bbar,
!    large amounts of ductile crack growth with the Gurson-
!    Tvergaard material model. the finite element model
!    has one-layer of elements with w=0 constraints everywhere
!    to impose plane-strain conditions.
!
!    computational "cell" size is D=200 um. due to symmetry then
!    the elements in the Gurson layer are 100 um x 100 um in size. 
!
!    we intentionally use large increments of imposed displacements
!    at the load point to create severe conditions for the
!    material model integration schemes and the adaptive solution
!    procedures. approximately 14 elements are killed in the first
!    40 load steps. After step ~30 lots of adaptive solutions are
!    present due to negative deformation jacobians in near tip 
!    elements, strain increments > 100 * eps-0 in near-tip
!    elements, integration failure in the material model.
!
!    the algorithms are designed to do whatever adaptivity
!    is required to push forward with the solution. the user
!    can then re-analyze the model with a much more realistic
!    (smaller) load step size.
!
!    J-integral values are computed occasionally during loading.
!
!    a restart file is also written along the way after every
!    10 or so load increments.
!
!    here we employ catastrophic, strain-controlled nucleation
!    to smoothly relax stresses in elements just prior to 
!    actually killing them.
!
!    the material in linear + power law with n=10, E/sig-0=500,
!    nu=0.3. initial porosity in the cell is 0.005.
