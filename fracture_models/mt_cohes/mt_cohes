c       Nasa MT, 12" wide (full width), with out-of-plane bending allowed
c       (caused by large negative T-stress). 1/4 symmetric model.
c
c       crack growth using nonlinear (large displ) interface elements
c       Mode I growth over the thickness which can develop
c       tunneling.
c
c       initial a/w = 0.5. Crack plane element size = 0.01"
c       full thickness is 2.3 mm. 2W=300 mm (12 in), 2a=150 mm (6 in.)
c
c       4, 8-node bricks over the thickness that transtion immediately 
c       to 4 and then 2 20-node bricks over the thickness to better model the
c       out-of-plane bending. crack plane has 4, 8-node interface
c       elements over the thickness with a nonlinear cohesive material
c       model. the simple exponential model and the PPR model are defined
c       for use. the PPR model properties make it match very closely the
c       exponential response.
c
c       this inout file uses the PPR cohesive model
c
c       background material is Al-2024T3 with segmental stress-strain
c       curve for L orientation
c
c       loading by remotely imposed axial displacements.
c       input is setup for 2000 uniform load steps. adaptive crack growth
c       reduces-increases the step sizes during the solutions.
c
c       the compute-output comamnd file stops analysis at 150 load steps 
c       for this example. 200 steps kills about 28 interface-cohesive elements.
c
c       the large displacement option makes achieving convergence more
c       difficult at large load levels.
