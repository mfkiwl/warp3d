c  
c  flat panel containing a circular hole. corner crack
c  on one side of hole. model is 1/2 symmetric.
c  remote tensile loading.
c
c  small strain analysis. 20-node brick elements collapsed at
c  crack front with mid-side nodes. crack tip nodes
c  allowed to "open" during deformation.
c
c  nonlinear, deformation plasticity model.
c
c  setup to run for 15 load steps.
c
c  get J at each point along crack front for each load step
c 
c  the J cutoff capability is employed to end (normally)
c  the solution when the ratio of J_{total}{ / J_{elastic}
c  exceeds 5 at any crack-front position.
