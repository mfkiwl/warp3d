C(T), 1T, 1/4 symmetric model, plane-sided

Specimen geometry in cutouts at hole are not quite same
as std. geometry in E1820. Impacts slightly K_I and eta plastic

1. Run the warp3d.inp file with output directed to file: woutput

2. Run the Python code: find_results.py

   Reads woutput file, extracts results, prints tables, computes
   K_I factor and eta-plastic factor.
